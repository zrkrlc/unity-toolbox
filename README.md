# unity-toolbox

This is where I keep all my reusable C# scripts and assets for Unity3D.

Examples of scripts you may find here include:
* EnableCharacterMovementFPS.cs
  - allows you to move a CharacterController using inputs set in InputManager, usually WASD or arrow keys
* EnableCameraMouseLook.cs
  - allows you to move a camera using your mouse; optionally syncs the roll of the parent CharacterController to the camera to allow FPS-style movement with EnableCharacterMovementFPS.cs
